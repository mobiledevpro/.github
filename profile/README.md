‚ö°Ô∏è I'm a Software Engineer from Ukraine with over 10 years of experience in software development and a Top-Rated freelance Developer on Upwork since 2016.

‚ö°Ô∏è Last 7 years I'm dealing mostly with Android Development and have been building modern [native] apps for devices running on Android OS from version 6 <sup>Marshmallow</sup> to 13 <sup>Tiramisu</sup> . It covers about ~96.2% of all android devices nowdays.

Despite the war between Ukraine and Russia and some issues with electricity after Russia's missile attacks, I'm still continue working from a safe place with autonomous power supply.
